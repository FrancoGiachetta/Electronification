Introduction
===

- A historical review of trading markets 
- Their relationship with technology
- Public blockchains as the new potential framework for trading markets.

<!-- end_slide -->

Historical perspective on technological change
===

- Technological and market evolution is not straightforward.
- Market are hesitant to embrace change
- Big structural changes only come after big crisis and shocks.

Examples:

- Peparwork Crisis
- Sept 11th and the electronification of check and securities settlement

Decomposing the trading stack
===

- What makes up a stack:
  1. Network.
  2. Custody and settlement.
  3. Coordination and process. 
  4. Price discovery.

Real-world RFQ trading stack (c. 1700)
===

- Inneficient network stack
- Centralized coordination and process.

An electronification of this stack would:
- Reduce latency
- Introduce custody and settlement

<!-- end_slide -->

Enter blockchain trading stack
===

- Eliminates spoofs via digital signatures
- Verifiable trades
- Permissionless
- Descentralized custody and coordination
- Trustless

<!-- end_slide -->

Conclusions and potential areas of future exploration
===

- Current markets operate in suboptimal forms.
- Current US laws pursue an increase in auctioners and reducing intermmiadate 
- Blockchains naturally solve these problems by eliminating intermidiaires, allow to operate more dynamically 

How would blockchain solve some market problems:
- Settlement time (as markets are 24/7 open)?
- What would blockchain look like in more traditional markets (health, supply-chain, intellectual property)?
- How would the market react to a shift from time priority transaction to fee priority?
